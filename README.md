# Node CRM

a [Sails](http://sailsjs.org) application (Using node) Using AngularJS for the front end. MongoDB for database managment. Bootstraps for layout. ( Will work on any device in the end ) 

To run - You need to get NodeJS/SailsJS/AngularJS/Bootstrap

You can always find each of these on github and get the code this way.
Down below I post how to do it through repositories

On Windows you can get Node.js from their site and then install npm from node. You can also get Bower to install angular. I will need to load up windows to write down the exact instructions.

I am pretty sure Mac also can use all of these repositories. Again will need to load instructions at another time.



Linux Install Instructions. Make sure you cd to the project folder



1) sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
2) sudo apt-get install npm

3) sudo npm -g install sails

4) bower install angular#1.3.8

5) git clone https://github.com/Ravonus/ticket.git

Running Everything

1) Make sure Node is good to go
2) node app.js
3) This will open Sails server you need to keep this running it does all your back end
4) Open http://localhost:1337
